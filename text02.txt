  X   he grumbles of nausea while being made to read or write at lower altitudes

  X   he confuses letters, numbers, word sequences because of his refusal to assimilate

  X   he repeats letters, numbers, and substitute sounds of words, just because

  X   he gripes about seeing sprits because he whistles at night summoning them

  X   he lies consistently about his vision, yet eye exams do not recognize broken glasses

  X   he is nosey, but lacks the acuity, mostly he just does not watch where is going

  X   he reads, rereads, rereads and rereads, with slight comprehension to rereading

  X   he spells phonetically, his teachers do not realize it is a pow-wow song
